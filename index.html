            Hi there! My Name is Simon Jam, Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineering Student at California Baptist University. This website is
            a portfolio of some of the work I have done over the years, as well as any experience that I have in the field. I am currently
            looking for an internship, so feel free to take a look around!.
